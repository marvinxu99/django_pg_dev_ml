Installing gettext package on Linux is as easy as running the following command on terminal:

apt-get update
apt-get install gettext

Windows

Download the following zip files from the GNOME servers http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/dependencies/ or from one of its mirrors;
X is the version number, we are requiring 0.19.8.1 or higher.

https://download.gnome.org/binaries/win64/dependencies/

gettext-runtime-X.zip
gettext-tools-X.zip
Extract the contents of the bin\ directories in both files to the same folder on your system (i.e. C:\Program Files\gettext-utils)

Update the system PATH:

Control Panel > System > Advanced > Environment Variables.
In the System variables list, click Path, click Edit.
Add ;C:\Program Files\gettext-utils\bin at the end of the Variable value field.
You may also use gettext binaries you have obtained elsewhere, so long as the following command works properly: 

xgettext --version
